All things ice.

## The_main_single.py
This file is used to calculate the ice volume fraction (Q), mean area (A), mean radius of curvature (r), mean readius of curvature cubed (r3). Running the file will prompt the user to select a frame directory and selecting an ROI.

## extract_frames.py
Run sample frames from movies. Adapted from earlier versions to extract frames for all movies in the selected directory.

## combined_graphs.py
Plot graphs (Q, A, r or r3) where axes are categorized by sucrose level and IBP variant.

## fit_data.py
Used to calculate best fits to the data. Currently has troubles calculating the best linear fit for some sets.
